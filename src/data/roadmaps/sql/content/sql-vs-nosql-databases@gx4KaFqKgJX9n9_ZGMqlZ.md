# SQL vs NoSQL

SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases represent two different approaches to data storage and retrieval. SQL databases use structured schemas and tables, emphasizing data integrity and complex queries through joins. NoSQL databases offer more flexibility in data structures, often sacrificing some consistency for scalability and performance. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on factors like data structure, scalability needs, consistency requirements, and the nature of the application.
