# GRANT and REVOKE

`GRANT` and `REVOKE` are SQL commands used to manage user permissions in a database. `GRANT` is used to give specific privileges (such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) on database objects to users or roles, while `REVOKE` is used to remove these privileges. These commands are essential for implementing database security, controlling access to sensitive data, and ensuring that users have appropriate permissions for their roles. By using `GRANT` and `REVOKE`, database administrators can fine-tune access control, adhering to the principle of least privilege in database management.
