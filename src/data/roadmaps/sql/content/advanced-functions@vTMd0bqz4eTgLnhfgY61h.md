# Advanced SQL Functions

Advanced SQL functions extend beyond basic queries and are used to perform complex calculations, data transformations, and analyses within a database. Some key advanced functions include:

	•	Window Functions: Functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and LAG() allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row without collapsing the result set.
	•	CTEs (Common Table Expressions): WITH clauses that enable the creation of temporary result sets, which can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
	•	Aggregate Functions: Advanced usage of GROUP BY with functions like GROUPING SETS, ROLLUP, and CUBE to create more complex aggregations.
	•	JSON Functions: Functions such as JSON_VALUE() and JSON_QUERY() allow querying and manipulating JSON data stored in SQL tables.
	•	String Functions: Functions like STRING_AGG() and CONCAT_WS() for advanced string manipulation and aggregation.

These advanced functions enable more powerful and flexible data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis, making SQL a robust tool for complex database operations.
