# Transaction Isolation Levels

Transaction isolation levels in SQL define the degree to which the operations in one transaction are visible to other concurrent transactions. There are typically four standard levels: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable. Each level provides different trade-offs between data consistency and concurrency. Understanding and correctly setting isolation levels is crucial for maintaining data integrity and optimizing performance in multi-user database environments.
