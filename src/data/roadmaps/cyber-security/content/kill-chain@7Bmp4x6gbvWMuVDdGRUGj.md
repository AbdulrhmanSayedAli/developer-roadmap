# Kill Chain

The kill chain is a cybersecurity framework that outlines the stages of a cyber attack, from initial reconnaissance to the final objective, typically exfiltration or destruction of data. Originally developed by Lockheed Martin for military purposes, the kill chain has been adapted for cybersecurity to help organizations understand and defend against attacks by breaking down the attack process into manageable steps.

The standard stages of a cyber kill chain are:

1. **Reconnaissance**: The attacker gathers information about the target, such as network architecture, employees, or vulnerabilities.
2. **Weaponization**: The attacker creates or customizes malware based on the gathered information to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
3. **Delivery**: The attacker delivers the weaponized payload to the target, often via phishing emails, infected websites, or malicious attachments.
4. **Exploitation**: The malware exploits vulnerabilities in the targetâ€™s system to execute malicious code.
5. **Installation**: The malware installs itself on the target system, often establishing a backdoor for persistent access.
6. **Command and Control (C2)**: The attacker establishes communication with the compromised system, allowing remote control and further exploitation.
7. **Actions on Objectives**: The attacker performs the intended actions, such as data theft, system disruption, or further propagation within the network.
